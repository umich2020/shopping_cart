what we need to test

1) the fetch api, it returns items based on an array
2) increasing and decreasing updates an state in i'm guessing main,
    although  it might be just the checkout page, hmm it could just be the parent
    which is order page and shoping cart which is actuall main
3) also adding stuff does that. It should also update the input as well. 
4) submitting a number changes it, ideally a modal should display this but we'll just run
a notification( i want to play with notifications)
